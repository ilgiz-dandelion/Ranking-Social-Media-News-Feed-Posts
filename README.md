# Ranking-Social-Media-News-Feed-Posts

In today's world of social media, users often find themselves flooded with countless posts in their news feeds. The problem is that many of these posts are not relevant to the users, making it challenging to discover content that genuinely interests them. This project focuses on tackling this issue by developing a system to rank social media news feed posts based on their relevance to individual users.

To achieve this goal, I used supervised learning models, which are computer algorithms that learn from labeled data. By studying the historical data, my goal was to predict whether a user will find a particular tweet relevant in the future.
